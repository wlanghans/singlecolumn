    !             NOTES ON THE PBLH FORMULATION
    !
    !The 1.5-theta-increase method defines PBL heights as the level at 
    !which the potential temperature first exceeds the minimum potential 
    !temperature within the boundary layer by 1.5 K. When applied to 
    !observed temperatures, this method has been shown to produce PBL-
    !height estimates that are unbiased relative to profiler-based 
    !estimates (Nielsen-Gammon et al. 2008). However, their study did not
    !include LLJs. Banta and Pichugina (2008) show that a TKE-based 
    !threshold is a good estimate of the PBL height in LLJs. Therefore,
    !a hybrid definition is implemented that uses both methods, weighting
    !the TKE-method more during stable conditions (PBLH < 400 m).
    !A variable tke threshold (TKEeps) is used since no hard-wired
    !value could be found to work best in all conditions.
