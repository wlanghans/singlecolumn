\section{Introduction}\label{se:intro}

For any prognostic variable $\rho\psi$ we seek to represent its tendency due to unresolved turbulent transport. Thereby, $\psi$ is one of $u$, $v$, $\theta_v$, $q_v$, and eventually $e$ (i.e., TKE).\footnote{Turbulent kinetic energy $e$ is included here since -- depending on the applied eddy-diffusivity model -- a prognostic equation for $e$ has eventually to be solved.} Here, $q_v$ is defined as the mass of water vapor per mass of moist air, as $q_v=\rho_v/(\rho_d+\rho_v)$. It is common in GCMs and mesoscale models to assume that the vertical velocity $w$ has no tendency from subgrid-scale transport. On top of that, subgrid transport is assumed to be vertical only. 

The air density $\rho=\rho_d+\rho_v$ is affected by turbulent mixing since its moisture content changes. The updated values of $\rho$, $\rho_v$, and any other variable $\rho \psi$ are consistently obtained as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho^{n+1}&=&\rho^n + \Delta t \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=\rho^n + \Delta t \frac{\partial \rho_v}{\partial t}=\rho^n + \Delta t \rho_d^n\left(\frac{\partial r_v}{\partial t}\right)_{turb} \\
\rho_v^{n+1}&=&\rho_v^n + \Delta t \rho_d^n\left(\frac{\partial r_v}{\partial t}\right)_{turb}\\
 (\rho\psi)^{n+1} &=& \rho^{n+1}\left[\psi^n + \Delta t \left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}\right)_{turb}\right]\\
\end{eqnarray}
whereby we used the fact that the density of dry air, $\rho_d=\frac{1-q_v}{q_v}\rho_v$, remains unchanged (i.e., we are only adding/removing water vapor molecules). Here $r_v=q_v/(1-q_v)$ is the mixing ratio of water vapor.  

The tendency for any variable $\psi$ (other than a mixing ratio) is then obtained from the EDMF equation as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:tendency}
 \left(\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}\right)_{turb} =-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial }{\partial z} \rho \left( ED^{\psi} + MF^{\psi}\right) = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial }{\partial z} \rho\left( -K_{\psi}(z)\frac{\partial \psi(z)}{\partial z} + \sum_i M_i(z) (\psi^{up}_i(z) - \psi(z) )\right)
\end{equation}
and the tendency for a mixing ratio (e.g., $r_v$) is analogously obtained with $\rho$ replaced by $\rho_d$. Here, ED is the eddy-diffusivity part and MF the (multiplume) mass-flux part of the turbulent flux. Closure is provided by specifying $K_{\psi}$, $M_i$, and $\psi^{up}_i$ for each updraft $i$.

The necessary/provided input to the EDMF parameterization is listed in section \ref{sec:input}. The closure is described in section \ref{sec:closure}. The numerical procedure to solve Eq. (\ref{eqn:tendency}) is outlined in section \ref{sec:solve}. One key advantage of this multiplume EDMF parameterization is that PBL mixing and shallow cumulus cloud cover are parameterized in a unified fashion since plumes might eventually get saturated. For this reason, several versions of EDMF also provide a subgrid-scale cloud cover (shallow cumulus and eventually also strato-cumulus) and unresolved cloud liquid water content which is then passed on to the radiative transfer code. The approach taken in this direction is described in section \ref{sec:clouds}.

\section{Input}\label{sec:input}

\subsection{From CAMR Dycore}

The prognostic variables $u$, $v$, $w$, $\theta_v$, $q_v$ and $\rho$ are provided at cell centers. In this 1D framework let index $k$ represent the vertical center of cell $k$. Let indices $k-1/2$ and $k+1/2$ indicate the position of the bottom and top interface of cell $k$. Thus, the input is $u^k$, $v^k$, $w^k$, $\theta_v^k$, $q_v^k$, and $\rho_k$ with $k$ ranging from $1$ to the total number of cells $N_k$ in the 1D column. On top of that, $\rho^{k\pm 1/2}$ will be needed from the Dycore. 

Also needed for the parameterization of eddy diffusivities is the squared characteristic rate of strain $\overline{D}^2$ (based on grid-scale velocities) as defined in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:def2}) at cell centers. 

\subsection{From surface flux parameterization}\label{sec:sfcfluxes}

The parameterization of surface fluxes over ocean surface is based on \cite{bryan03} and has been used also in SAM \citep{khairou03} and CAM \citep[see][section 4.10.2]{collins04}. A formulation for fluxes over land is also available but not yet included. The formulation is adapted here to our needs as explained below. A bulk drag/transfer law is used for the surface turbulent fluxes of $u$, $v$, $\theta$, and $r_v$, given as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fluxes}
 (\mathbf{\tau}, E, H)=-\rho_1|\mathbf{v_h}_1| (C_d \mathbf{v_h}_1, C_e \Delta r_v, C_{\theta} \Delta \theta )
\end{equation}
with $\Delta r_v=r_{v1}-r_v^*(T_s)$, $\Delta \theta=\theta_{1}-\theta_{s}$, $\mathbf{v_h}$ the horizontal wind vector, and $C_d$, $C_e$, and $C_{\theta}$ the transfer coefficients for momentum, $r_v$, and $\theta$. $T_s$ is the surface temperature and $r_v^*(T_s)$ the saturation mixing ratio at the surface temperature. Index ``$1$'' indicates values on the first model level. 

Turbulent velocity scales $u_*$, $r_{v*}$, and $\theta_{*}$ are introduced in the formulation of these fluxes as 
\begin{eqnarray}
 u_*&=& (\overline{u'w'}^2+\overline{v'w'}^2)^{1/4} = C_d^{1/2} | \mathbf{v_h}_1 |\\
 r_{v*}&=& -\overline{r_v'w'}/u_*=C_e |\mathbf{v_h}_1| \Delta r_v / u_*\label{eqn:velqv}
\end{eqnarray}

The parameterization characterizes the surface layer stability based on the Monin-Obukhov length and then distinguishes between flux profiles for stable and unstable conditions. The parameterization proceeds by utilizing similarity theory to determine the drag coefficients $C_d$, $C_e$, and $C_{\theta}$ and the respective fluxes. That is, the parameterization provides the sensible heat flux.  Note that here we seek a flux of $\theta_v$. The required flux in kinematic units is obtained as 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:wthetav}
 \overline{\theta_v'w'}\approx \overline{\theta'w'}(1+0.61q_{v1}) + 0.61 \theta_1  \overline{r_v'w'}.
\end{equation}
This approximation implied dropping the contribution from the triple-correlation $\overline{w'q_v'\theta'}$ \citep[same as in Eq.~(10) in][]{stull94}. However, note that the flux of virtual potential temperature is commonly even further approximated as $\overline{\theta_v'w'}=\overline{\theta'w'}+0.61 \theta_1  \overline{r_v'w'}$ \citep[e.g.,][Eq.~(10.11)]{wyngaard10}. 

Using the bulk transfer law $H_v=-\rho_1|\mathbf{v_h}_1| C_{\theta_v}\Delta \theta_{v}$ and setting this equal to the flux obtained through (\ref{eqn:wthetav}) yields 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dragvirtual}
C_{\theta_v}=(C_h\Delta \theta [1+0.61q_{v1}] + 0.61 C_e\theta_1\Delta r_v)/ \Delta \theta_{v}. 
\end{equation}



\section{EDMF closure}\label{sec:closure}

The task of the parameterization is to provide the eddy diffusivities $K_{\psi}$ and $M_i$ and $\psi^{up}_i$ for each updraft $i$. A variety of flavors of the 1.5 TKE closure are implemented and described below. The updraft properties are obtained through a multiplume model that was kindly provided by Kay Suselj/JPL and somewhat modified here.


\subsection{Eddy-diffusivity models}

The eddy diffusivities are computed at cell centers and averaging provides $K_{\psi}^{k\pm 1/2}$ at cell interfaces. 

% \subsubsection{Smagorinsky closure}
% 
% This LES closure relates the eddy diffusivity for momentum to the characteristic rate of strain $\overline{D}$, as
% \begin{equation}\label{eqn:viscosity}
% K_m=(c_s l)^2 \overline{D}\sqrt{\max\left(0,1-\frac{\mathrm{Ri}}{\mathrm{Ri}_{c}}\right)}
% \end{equation}
% with the Richardson number defined as 
% \begin{equation}
%  \mathrm{Ri}=\left\{
% \begin{array}{ll}
% N_m^2/\overline{D}^2&\mathrm{for~saturated~air}\\
% N^2/\overline{D}^2&\mathrm{for~unsaturated~air}.
% \end{array}
% \right.  
% \end{equation} 
% and $\mathrm{Ri}_c=1.0$ a critical Richardson number and $N$ and $N_m$ the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} frequencies in unsaturated and saturated air, respectively. Air is defined saturated if the mixing ratio of non-precipitating condensate is larger than a certain threshold. Equation (\ref{eqn:viscosity}) can be rewritten as 
% \begin{equation}
% K_m=(c_s l)^2 \sqrt{\max\left(0,\overline{D}^2-\frac{N^2}{\mathrm{Ri}_{c}}\right)}
% \end{equation}
% and equivalently using $N_m^2$ in case of saturated air (only $N^2$ is used for brevity below). The mixing length scale $l$ is stability dependent and expressed as
% \begin{equation}\label{eqn:lmixsmag}
%  l=\left\{ 
%  \begin{array}{ll}
%  \min(\Delta z, \max(0.1\Delta z, 0.76 \sqrt{(e/N^2)}))&\quad \mathrm{if}\quad N^2>0\\
%  \Delta z &\quad \mathrm{if}\quad N^2\leq 0.
%  \end{array}
% \right.  
% \end{equation}
% with $e$ the TKE distribution from the previous timestep that (ideally) got advected by the Dycore. TKE is then diagnosed as 
% \begin{equation}
%  e = (K_m/(c_kl))^2.
% \end{equation}
% The constant $c_s$ is given through the relation $c_s^4=c_k^3/c_e$ with $c_k=0.1$ and $c_e=0.54+1.44 l/\Delta z$. The eddy diffusivity for scalar transport is obtained as $K_h=\mathrm{Pr}K_m$ with the Prandtl number set to $\mathrm{Pr}=1/\mathrm{Ri}_c=1$. 
% 
% The square of the characteristic rate of strain $\overline{D}^2$ is defined as $\overline{D}^2=2D_{ij}D_{ij}$ with element $(i,j)$ of the tensor given as
% \begin{equation}
%  D_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\partial U_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial U_j}{\partial x_i})
% \end{equation}
% with capital $U$ indicating the grid-scale velocity and indices $i$ and $j$ are one of the three coordinate directions. After summation one obtains 
% \begin{equation}\label{eqn:def2}
%  \overline{D}^2=2\{D_{11}^2+D_{22}^2+D_{33}^2\}+4\{D_{12}^2+D_{13}^2+D_{23}^2 \}
% \end{equation}
% which is provided from the Dycore at cell centers. 


\subsubsection{Teixeira TKE closure}

The formulation of the TKE boundary layer scheme follows the description given by \cite{teixeira04} and is specifically designed here to model the evolution of the dry convective boundary layer. The prognostic equation for $e$, the sgs kinetic energy per unit dry air, is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:tkebudget}
 \frac{\partial e}{\partial t}&=& \mathrm{ADV} + \mathrm{TRANS} + \mathrm{SHEAR} + \mathrm{BUOY} - \mathrm{DISS}
\end{eqnarray}
and in this parameterization the individual sources/sinks are closed as
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mathrm{TRANS} &=& \frac{1}{\rho_d}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (\rho_d K_m  \frac{\partial e}{\partial z})\\
 \mathrm{SHEAR} &=& K_m \overline{D}^2 \\
 \mathrm{BUOY} &=& \frac{g}{\theta_v}\overline{w'\theta_v'}\\
 \mathrm{DISS}&=& c_{\epsilon}\sqrt{e}/l_{\epsilon}
\end{eqnarray}
with $K_m=c_k l e^{1/2}$, $l_{\epsilon}=l/2.5$, $c_{\epsilon}=0.16$, and $c_k=0.5$.

The square of the characteristic rate of strain $\overline{D}^2$ is generally defined as $\overline{D}^2=2D_{ij}D_{ij}$ with element $(i,j)$ of the tensor given as
\begin{equation}
 D_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\partial U_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial U_j}{\partial x_i})
\end{equation}
with capital $U$ indicating the grid-scale velocity and indices $i$ and $j$ are one of the three coordinate directions. After summation one obtains 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:def2}
 \overline{D}^2=2\{D_{11}^2+D_{22}^2+D_{33}^2\}+4\{D_{12}^2+D_{13}^2+D_{23}^2 \}
\end{equation}
which is provided from the Dycore at cell centers. In the here relevant 1D case this reduces to $\overline{D}^2=(dU/dz)^2+(dV/dz)^2$.

The eddy diffusivity for heat and moisture fluxes is $K_h=\mathrm{Pr} K_m$ with $\mathrm{Pr}=1$. The mixing length is obtained as
\begin{eqnarray}
 l &=& \tau \sqrt{e} + (\kappa z - \tau \sqrt{e}) e^{-z/\alpha}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\alpha=100\mathrm{~m}$ and $\tau$ taken to be either 600 sec or $\tau=0.5 h/w^*$ with $w^*=(hg/\theta_{v0} \overline{w'\theta_v'}|_0)^{1/3}$. 

The boundary layer height $h$ is defined as either the height where the buoyancy flux from the previous step is minimized (a somewhat inconsistent numerical treatment) or as the height where the $\theta_v$ gradient at step $n$ is maximized. A third option to obtain $h$ is made available through code adapted from WRF and implies an evaluation of both $e$ and $\theta_v$ profiles. 


\subsubsection{Witek TKE closure}

The Witek closure follows mostly the description given by \cite{witek11}. It is an EDMF closure. The MF model is described below. The ED part is very similar to the above described Teixeira closure. Only the differences are described here.

The MF part of the buoyancy flux is considered in the production term for TKE. This is argued to produce a proper buoyancy profile near the slightly stable parts of the BL and at the inversion. 
Moreover, some constants and the disspiation length take different values/definitions:

\begin{eqnarray}
 c_k&=&0.425\\
 Pr&=&0.5882\\
 C_{\epsilon}&=&0.304\\
 l_{\epsilon}&=&l
\end{eqnarray}

The definition of the length scale differs from Witek's paper and is closer to the proposal be \cite{suselj13}:

\begin{eqnarray}
 l &=&l_{23} + (\kappa z - l_{23}) e^{-z/\alpha} \\
 l_{23}^{-1}&=&l_{2}^{-1} + l_{3}^{-1}\\
 l_{2} &=& \tau \sqrt{e}\\
 l_{3} &=& \left\{ 
 \begin{array}{ll}
  \max(\Delta z/2, 0.7 \sqrt{(e/N^2)})&\quad \mathrm{if}\quad N^2>0\\
  \infty &\quad \mathrm{if}\quad N^2\leq 0.
  \end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}
In neutral or unstable conditions it is the same as for the Teixeira closure as long as $\alpha$ and $\tau$ receive the same definitions (i.e., $\alpha=100$~m and $\tau=0.5h/w_*$). However, in locally stable conditions the length scale gets reduced. Here, $\tau$ may take a constant value of 400~s (same as in \cite{suselj13}) or be defined as in the Teixeira closure as $\tau=0.5 h/w_*$. We avoid the exact definition from \cite{witek11} since it would require the computation of the friction velocity $u_*$ based on surface layer similarity theory. It is more complicated to define the latter under calm conditions and thus avoided so far.  

\subsubsection{Emerging reference TKE closure}

{\color{blue} Goal: Add description of emerging TKE closure that will be used in the Dycore. The keys to a successful (i.e., applicability in different PBLs, possibility to MF extension) TKE closure should be highlighted and reviewed.}

\subsection{Multiplume model}

\subsubsection{Description}

The multiplume model provides updraft properties for a user-set number of plumes and thus the MF-part in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:tendency}). It closely follows the proposed multiplume model of \cite{cheinet03a}. Each plume represents one class of updrafts with the same thermodynamic and kinematic properties. Note that in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:tendency}) it has been assumed that $\psi_d$ of the undisturbed subsiding air in the environment equals the grid-box mean $\psi$. This is equivalent to assuming that the updraft/downdraft area is small. This assumption is not made in, e.g., \cite{cheinet03a}. Following \cite{suselj12}, \cite{suselj13}, and \cite{suselj14} the MF part is assumed to be zero in case of $\psi$ equal to $u$, $v$, or $e$ {\color{blue}(Can we add these MF tendencies for $u$, $v$, or $e$?)}. This is generally justified by the smaller eddy viscosities for momentum than for heat and the general lack in knowledge about sources/sinks of momentum within a rising plume \citep[see, e.g., discussion in][]{han15}. Index $i$ identifies an individual updraft class among a total of $N^{up}$ (to be specified, e.g., $N^{up}=10$) updrafts. $M_i$ is defined as $s_i w^{up}_i$ with $s_i$ and $w^{up}_i$ the fractional weight and vertical velocity, respectively, of updraft class $i$. 


Initial conditions are obtained as in \cite{cheinet03a} and \cite{lenschow80}. Through similarity theory the initial conditions are linked to surface fluxes, boundary layer depth, and an assumed PDF of the vertical velocity. The latter is assumed to be a Gaussian with standard deviation $\sigma_w$, given as

\begin{equation}
 f_w(w) = \frac{1}{\sigma_w 2 \pi } e^{-\frac{w^2}{2\sigma_w^2}}.
\end{equation}


A fixed number of plume classes spans a discrete PDF for a selected range between $w_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $w_{\mathrm{max}}$. Class $i$ covers all plumes with vertical velocities between

\begin{eqnarray}
 w_i^{\mathrm{min}}&=&w_{\mathrm{min}}+(i-1)(w_{\mathrm{max}}-w_{\mathrm{min}})/N^{up} \qquad\mathrm{and}\\
 w_i^{\mathrm{max}}&=&w_{\mathrm{min}}+i(w_{\mathrm{max}}-w_{\mathrm{min}})/N^{up},
\end{eqnarray}
has a fractional weight
\begin{equation}
 s_i =\int\limits_{w_i^{\mathrm{min}}}^{w_i^{\mathrm{max}}} dw~f_w(w)=1/2(\mathrm{erf}(\frac{w_i^{\mathrm{max}}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_w}) - \mathrm{erf}(\frac{w_i^{\mathrm{min}}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_w})),
\end{equation}
and an average initial updraft velocity
\begin{equation}
 w_i =  1/s_i\int\limits_{w_i^{\mathrm{min}}}^{w_i^{\mathrm{max}}} dw~f(w)~ w =\frac{\sigma_w}{s_i \sqrt{2 \pi }} (e^{-\frac{{w_i^{\mathrm{min}}}^2}{2 \sigma_w^2}}- e^{-\frac{{w_i^{\mathrm{max}}}^2}{2 \sigma_w^2}}).
\end{equation}
{\color{blue} This initial average velocity has been modified here from the original $1/2(w_i^{\mathrm{min}}+w_i^{\mathrm{max}})$ used by Kay/JPL in order to make sure that the total upward mass flux $\int\limits_0^{\infty} dw~f_w w = \sum_{i=1,N_p} s_i w_i $ is independent of $N_p$. To illustrate the difference, if $w_{\mathrm{min}}=0$ and $w_{\mathrm{max}}\gg\sqrt{2}\sigma_w$ then the total area covered by the discretized updraft class spectrum is $A_tot=0.5$. Then, if only one plume was used the average initial velocity obtains the correct mean value $w_1=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \sigma_w$. In contrast, the unmodified code gives $0.5 w_i^{\mathrm{max}}$ (which would be correct only if $w_i^{\mathrm{max}}=2\sqrt{2/\pi}\sigma_w$). This update should allow for better convergence characteristics with an increasing number of plumes.} 


The actual physical area $a_i$ of one plume within a class spanned between $w_i^{\mathrm{min}}$ and $w_i^{\mathrm{max}}$ results from 
\begin{equation}
A_i/A_{tot} = s_i = \int_i dw~f(w) = 1/A_{tot} \int_i dw~N(w)a(w) 
\end{equation}
with $N(w)$ the number density [(m~s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$] of plumes as a function of velocity and $a(w)$ the plume area size as function of vertical velocity. If we assume that each class has a mean number and mean size of plumes then we can rewrite this, as $ s_i=a_i/A_{tot} N_i$, such that 
\begin{equation}
 a_i= s_i A_{tot}/N_i.
\end{equation}
{\color{blue}Thus, specifying $N_i$ in addition is necessary in order to specify the size of plumes and thus their mass flux and eventually entrainment rates. The same weighting factor $s_i$ might correspond to a large number of plumes with small fractional area or to a small number of plumes with large fractional area. The outcome might be largely different. Let's discuss this.}


% 
% $\int\limits_{w_i^{\mathrm{min}}}^{w_i^{\mathrm{max}}} dw~ f(w) =\frac{1}{A_{tot}}\int\limits dA~N^*_i a_i$ with $N^*_i$ the number density (m$^{-2}$) and $a_i$ the areal extent of updrafts with velocities in the range $w_i^{\mathrm{min}}<w<w_i^{\mathrm{max}}$. The distributions $N^*_i(x,y)$ and $a_i(x,y)$ are defined to be zero whenever $w(x,y)$ falls outside of the specified range of the class. Of course, we can try and assume that all updrafts in one class have the same size such that 
% 
% \begin{equation}
%  f_i = \frac{\int\limits_{w_i^{\mathrm{min}}}^{w_i^{\mathrm{max}}} dw~ f(w) }{ \int\limits_{A_{tot}} dA~N^*_i}= \frac{s_i }{ N_i}.
% \end{equation}
% 
% Specifying $s_i$ thus leaves us to specify either the total number of updrafts represented by class $i$ or their fractional area $f_i$, but obviously not both.

To obtain initial conditions, we follow \cite{lenschow80} and diagnose the standard deviations of $w$, $\theta$, and $q_v$ from the surface layer similarty relations
\begin{eqnarray}
 \sigma_w&=&1.34 w^*(z_s/h)^{1/3} (1-0.8z_s/h)\\
   \sigma_{q_t}&=&1.34 q_v^* (z_s/h)^{-1/3}\\\label{eqn:sigmaq}
  \sigma_{\theta}&=&1.34\theta^* (z_s/h)^{-1/3}\label{eqn:sigmath}
\end{eqnarray}
with 
\begin{eqnarray}
  w^*&=&(hg/\theta_v \overline{w'\theta_v'})^{1/3}\\
  q_v^*&=&\overline{w'q_v'}/w^*\\
  \theta^*&=&\overline{w'\theta'}/w^*\\
\end{eqnarray}
and $z_s$ is set to be 50 meter and supposed to be in the surface layer. As shown by \cite[][see their Fig.~12]{sorbjan91}, the correlation coefficient between water vapor and potential temperature is $r_{q_v\theta}\approx 0.75$ {\color{blue}(note that \cite{cheinet03a} gets this number wrong)} in the surface layer such that the standard deviation of virtual potential temperature can be obtained, as  
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:sigmathv}
 \sigma_{\theta_v}= (\sigma_{\theta}^2 + 0.61^2 \theta^2\sigma_{q_t}^2+2\cdot 0.61\theta r_{q_v\theta} \sigma_{\theta} \sigma_{q_t} )^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
{\color{blue}The correlation coefficient $r_{q_v\theta}$ might be different over water, right? (even negative: cold pools picking up vapor from ocean)}

Finally, the perturbations to the mean values are obtained -- again using correlation coefficients from \cite{cheinet03a} -- as 

\begin{eqnarray}
 q_{vi}&=&q_{v}+0.32 w_i  \sigma_{q_t}/\sigma_w\\
 \theta_{vi}&=&\theta_{v}+0.58 w_i  \sigma_{\theta_v}/\sigma_w\\
  \theta_{li}&=&\theta_{vi}/(1+\epsilon q_{vi})=\theta_i \quad\mathrm{since}~q_{li}=0.
\end{eqnarray}


If we decide to use a single plume model ($N^{up}=1$), then we might alternatively opt for the initial conditions defined in \cite{soares04} and \cite{witek11}. Therein, 
\begin{equation}
 \theta_{v1} =  \theta_{v}+\beta \overline{\theta_v'w'}/e^{1/2}
\end{equation}
with $\beta$ typically set to 0.3 \citep{soares04,witek11}. An analogous relation is used to relate $q_v$ to the surface latent heat flux. The intial vertical velocity is zero. Note that $\beta$ will set the intial plume buoyancy. The fractional area of the plume is assumed to be $s_i=0.1$.

Steady-state entraining plumes are then used to describe the vertical thermodynamic and dynamic profiles. A conserved quantity $\psi$ follows the vertical profile given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:conserved}
 \frac{d\psi_i^{up} }{d z } &=& - \epsilon(\psi_i^{up} - \psi)
\end{eqnarray}
with entrainment rate $\epsilon$ and the environmental value $\psi$. The parcel rises until its vertical velocity reaches zero. The latter is given by \cite{simpson69a}'s parameterization
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:w}
 1/2\frac{d (w_i^{up})^2 }{d z } &=& aB^{up}_i- (b+c\epsilon)(w_i^{up})^2
\end{eqnarray}
with buoyancy $B_i^{up}=g(\theta_v^{up}/\theta_v-1)$, the environmental profile $\theta_v$, and constants  $a=2/3$, $b=0.002$~m$^{-1}$, $c=1.5$. The three acceleration terms are buoyancy, form drag, and mixing drag. 

Entrainment is described by either a Poisson process (see next section), by a fixed fractional entrainment rate $\epsilon=\epsilon0$, by \cite{witek11}'s formulation
\begin{equation}
 \epsilon=\frac{0.7}{l}
\end{equation}
or by \cite{neggers02}'s formulation
\begin{equation}
 \epsilon=\frac{\alpha_n}{\tau w}
\end{equation}
with $\tau=h/w_*$ the eddy turnover time as defined before and $\alpha_n$ a tuning parameter.

The conserved variables used in the plume equations are liquid water potential temperature $\theta_l$ and total water mass fraction $q_t=q_v+q_l$. Equation (\ref{eqn:conserved}) is solved for these two variables until the vertical velocity in a plume turns zero. At each height a saturation adjustment scheme is used to infer the liquid water content $q_l$, $q_v$, and $\theta_v$. 

\subsubsection{Emerging reference MF closure}

{\color{blue} Goal: Add description of emerging MF closure that will be used in the Dycore. The keys to a successful (i.e., applicability in different PBLs, skill in representing cloud cover, match with ED closure) MF closure should be highlighted and reviewed.}

\subsubsection{Discretization}
Solving the vertical velocity and scalar equation in the vertical is accomplished as in \cite{suselj14} (see their appendix). Thereby we assume that $\epsilon$, the environment value $\psi$, and buoyancy $B$ can be considered constant in each layer (instead of, e.g., $\epsilon(\psi^{up}-\psi)$ being constant) to obtain an analytical expression for $\psi$ at the next level. This method has the numerical advantage that $\psi^{up}$ at the next higher level will be bound in between the value of $\psi^{up}$ at the lower level and the environmental value of $\psi$ in that layer. This provides the mass flux properties ($M_i^{k\pm 1/2}$ and $\psi^{up~k\pm 1/2}_i$) on cell interfaces. The discretized equations are 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \psi_i^{up~k+1/2}&=&\psi^{~k}(1-e^{-\epsilon^{k}\Delta z^k})+\psi_i^{up~k-1/2}e^{-\epsilon^{k}\Delta z^k}\\
 (w_i^{up~k+1/2})^2&=&(\alpha w_i^{up~k-1/2})^2 + (1-\alpha^2) \frac{aB_i^{up~k}}{b+c\epsilon^k},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha=e^{-(b+c\epsilon^k)\Delta z^k}$ and $B_i^{up~k}=g(0.5(\theta_{vi}^{up~k+1/2}+\theta_{vi}^{up~k-1/2})/\theta_v^{k}-1)$. The entrainment rate (m$^{-1}$) in layer $\Delta z^k$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
 \epsilon(\Delta z^k) = \frac{1}{\Delta z^k} \epsilon_d \mathcal{P}(\frac{\Delta z^k}{L_0})
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon_d=0.1$, $L_0=100$~m, and $\mathcal{P}$ a random number drawn from the Poisson distribution. The entrainment rate is thus so far formulated identically for the different updraft classes. 


\section{Solving for the tendencies}\label{sec:solve}

\subsection{EDMF equation}

Equation (\ref{eqn:tendency}) needs to be solved to obtain tentendy $T^{\psi}$. The spatial discretization of the equations is done using a centered scheme for the diffusion term and the mass-flux term. $K$, $M_i$, and $\psi^{up}_i$ are treated explicitly in time while other terms can be implicit. \footnote{{\color{blue} If the prognostic TKE closure is used then SAM would use an intermediate $K$ obtained from an intermediate $e$ that got advanced through a truncated budget (\ref{eqn:tkebudget}) without the TRANS term. TRANS (i.e. mixing) is then computed based on the intermediate $e$ and $K$. We find, however, that this approach leads to strange instabilities in a CPBL test. Thus, we use a truly explicit approach for $e$ and $K$.}} For brevity we drop index $_\psi$ here for eddy diffusivities $K$. The vertical grid structure and the indexing is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:staggering} and is the same as used by \cite{tiedtke89}. An important stability criterion -- realized by \cite{tiedtke89} -- is that the environmental value of $\psi$ at the interface $k+1/2$ can not be taken as the average between $k$ and $k+1$. The interface value of $\psi$ is needed in the subsidence term $- \psi(z) \sum_i M_i(z)$ and in line with an upwind discretization has to be interpolated/taken from above. Since all prognostic variables are to a good approximation conserved along the unsaturated downdraft (besides detrainment effects) we simply say $\psi^{k+1/2}=\psi^{k+1}$ and  $\psi^{k-1/2}=\psi^{k}$. We find that taking the average indeed results in numerical instabilities, while this approach works fine. The discretized form of Eq. (\ref{eqn:tendency}) is then
\begin{align*}
  &\frac{\psi^{n+1,k}- \psi^{n,k} }{\Delta t} =\\
  &-\frac{1}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^{k}}\left\{ -\frac{K^{n,k+1/2}\rho^{n,k+1/2} }{\Delta z^{k+1/2}} [\beta_1^+(\psi^{n+1,k+1}-\psi^{n+1,k}) + \beta_1^-(\psi^{n,k+1}-\psi^{n,k})] \right. \\
    & \left.+\frac{K^{n,k-1/2}\rho^{n,k-1/2} }{\Delta z^{k-1/2}} [\beta_1^+(\psi^{n+1,k}-\psi^{n+1,k-1}) + \beta_1^-(\psi^{n,k}-\psi^{n,k-1})] \right.\\
    & \left. +\rho^{n,k+1/2}\left[\sum_i M_i^{n,k+1/2}\psi_i^{up~n,k+1/2} - (\beta_2^+\psi^{n+1,k+1}+\beta_2^-\psi^{n,k+1} )\sum_i M_i^{n,k+1/2} \right]\right.\\
    &\left.-\rho^{n,k-1/2}\left[\sum_i M_i^{n,k-1/2}\psi_i^{up~n,k-1/2} -(\beta_2^+\psi^{n+1,k}+\beta_2^-\psi^{n,k} )\sum_i M_i^{n,k-1/2} \right] \right\}\\
\end{align*}
with $\beta_1^+=1-\beta_1^-$ and $\beta_2^+=1-\beta_2^-$ the implicit weights. A fully implicit solver, i.e., $\beta_1^{+}=\beta_2^{+}=1$, is mostly used here. A tridiagonal matrix solver is used to solve $\mathbf{A}\cdot\Psi^{n+1}=\mathbf{d}$ for $\Psi^{n+1}$. 

\noindent For $2\leq k \leq N_k-1$ the coefficients are given as 

\begin{align*}
  a_k &=  \frac{\rho^{n,k-1/2}}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left[\beta_1^+ \frac{K^{n,k-1/2}}{\Delta z ^{k-1/2}}\right]\\
    b_k &= -\frac{1}{\Delta t} + \frac{\rho^{n,k+1/2}}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left[-\beta_1^+\frac{K^{n,k+1/2}}{\Delta z ^{k+1/2}} \right]-\frac{\rho^{n,k-1/2}}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left[\beta_1^+\frac{K^{n,k-1/2}}{\Delta z ^{k-1/2}}+\beta_2^+\sum_iM_i^{n,k-1/2} \right] \\
      c_k &= \frac{\rho^{n,k+1/2}}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k}\left[\beta_1^+ \frac{K^{n,k+1/2}}{\Delta z ^{k+1/2}}+\beta_2^+\sum_iM_i^{n,k+1/2} \right] \\
      d_k &=-\frac{\psi^{n,k}}{\Delta t} - \frac{1}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left\{ \frac{K^{n,k+1/2}\rho^{n,k+1/2}}{\Delta z^{k+1/2}}\beta_1^{-}\left[\psi^{n,k+1} - \psi^{n,k}\right]-\frac{K^{n,k-1/2}\rho^{n,k-1/2}}{\Delta z^{k-1/2}}\beta_1^{-}\left[\psi^{n,k} - \psi^{n,k-1}\right]\right.   \\   
          & \left.+\rho^{n,k-1/2}\left[\sum_iM_i^{n,k-1/2}\psi_i^{up~n,k-1/2} - \beta_2^{-}\psi^{n,k}\sum_iM_i^{n,k-1/2} \right]\right.\\
          & \left. -\rho^{n,k+1/2}\left[\sum_iM_i^{n,k+1/2}\psi_i^{up~n,k+1/2} - \beta_2^{-}\psi^{n,k+1}\sum_iM_i^{n,k+1/2} \right] \right\}.
\end{align*}

\noindent The boundary conditions at the surface are specified for $k=1$, as

\begin{align*}
  a_k &= 0 \\
    b_k &= -\frac{1}{\Delta t} +\frac{\rho^{n,k+1/2}}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left[- \beta_1^+\frac{K^{n,k+1/2}}{\Delta z^{k+1/2}} \right]-\beta_1^+|\mathbf{v_{h1}}|C^n_{\psi}/\Delta z^k  \\
      c_k &= \mathrm{same~as~for~}2\leq k \leq N_k-1 \\
      d_k &=  -\frac{\psi^{n,k}}{\Delta t} - \frac{1}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left\{ \frac{K^{n,k+1/2}\rho^{n,k+1/2}}{\Delta z^{k+1/2}}\beta_1^{-}\left[\psi^{n,k+1} - \psi^{n,k}\right]\right.   \\   
          & \left. -\rho^{n,k+1/2}\left[\sum_iM_i^{n,k+1/2}\psi_i^{up~n,k+1/2} -\beta_2^{-}\psi^{n,k+1}\sum_iM_i^{n,k+1/2} \right] \right\} +|\mathbf{v_{h1}}|\frac{C^n_{\psi}}{\Delta z^k}\left[\beta^-\psi^{n,k} - \psi_s\right]    
\end{align*}
This formulation with Dirichlet boundary conditions makes use of the drag coefficients computed in the surface scheme and through (\ref{eqn:dragvirtual}). The user can, however, also decide to use a Neuman boundary condition ({\tt doneuman=.true.}) using the fluxes from the surface scheme and from (\ref{eqn:wthetav}). In this case, the last rhs term in $b_k$ is dropped and the last term in $d_k$ becomes $- \overline{\psi'w'}^n/\Delta z^k$ makeing the surface fluxes fully explicit. This explicit Neuman boundary condition is also used if surface fluxes are prescribed ({\tt sfc\_tau\_fxd} or {\tt sfc\_flx\_fxd} respectively). 

The boundary condition at the top for $k=N_k$ is given as
\begin{align*}
  a_k &= \mathrm{same~as~for~}2\leq k \leq N_k-1  \\
    b_k &= -\frac{1}{\Delta t} - \frac{\rho^{n,k-1/2}}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left[\beta_1^+\frac{K^{n,k-1/2}}{\Delta z ^{k-1/2}}+\beta_2^+\sum_iM_i^{n,k-1/2} \right] \\
      c_k &= 0 \\
      d_k &= -\frac{\psi^{n,k}}{\Delta t} + \frac{1}{\rho^{n,k}\Delta z^k} \left\{ \frac{K^{n,k-1/2}\rho^{n,k-1/2}}{\Delta z^{k-1/2}}\beta_1^{-}\left[\psi^{n,k} - \psi^{n,k-1}\right]\right.   \\   
          & \left.-\rho^{n,k-1/2}\left[\sum_iM_i^{n,k-1/2}\psi_i^{up~n,k-1/2} -\beta_2^{-}\psi^{n,k}\sum_iM_i^{n,k-1/2} \right]\right\}.    
\end{align*}
Again, $\rho$ needs to be replaced by $\rho_d$ in case of $\psi=r_v$ or $\psi=e$. 

\subsection{TKE equation}

The numerical implementation to advance $e$ from step $n$ to step $n+1$ is as follows. SHEAR, BUOY, and DISS are treated explicitly with an Euler step. Thereby, $K_m$ at step $n$ is diagnosed from $e$ at step $n$. {\color{blue} This is for example different in SAM where $K^n$ is obtained from an intermediate $e$. What's generally done here? Also is TRANS computed on the intermediate $e$ or $e$ at step $n$.} The three tendencies will be limited in magnitude to ensure their sum is not smaller than $-\frac{e}{\Delta t}$. Then, TRANS is computed as described below (general formulation allowing for an implicit solver) again based on the $e$ distribution (and $K$) at step $n$. That means that TRANS may still cause some negative $e$ at step $n+1$ since the solver for TRANS is not necessarily positive definite. Negative $e$ will be clipped at the beginning of the next step.  The advective term ADV is eventually computed by the Dycore which has TKE per mass of moist air as prognostic variable such that conversion is required before passing over and receiving $e$ (i.e., analogous to the water vapor mixing ratio). 

The buoyancy flux at time $n$ is needed in the buoyancy production term. The ED part of the flux requires knowledge about $K=C_k l e^{1/2}$. $e$ is available from the previous timestep (if a diagnostic scheme would be used then $e$ might still get advected by the Dycore and is thus treated like a prognostic variable) but $l$ needs to be re-evaluated at step $n$. To this end, the boundary layer height $h$ is required (since $l~ \tau e^{1/2}$ and $\tau ~ h/w^*$). It is computed either consistently at step $n$ if defined as the height where the $\theta_v$ gradient at step $n$ is maximized or somewhat inconsistently if defined as the height where the buoyancy flux at $n-1$ gets minimized.  Note that $h$ is also required as input to the mupliplume model and the same strategy is applied there. The MF fluxes at step $n$ might be included in the buoyancy flux of the buoyancy generation term (as done in the Witek scheme) and the plume model is thus called before evaluating the TKE sources.

\end{figure}

\section{Sensitivities}
\subsection{ED closure}

The dry CPBL case as described in \cite{nieuwstadt93} and \cite{witek11} is utilized here to test several sensitivities of the ED closures. 

\subsubsection{Lower BC on TKE}

Two BCs are compared: Neumann condition with zero flux of TKE at the surface and a Dirichlet condition with zero TKE at the surface (same as in \cite{teixeira04}). The zero-flux condition follows the LES model used by \cite{deardorff74} and is also in line with findings presented by \cite{mcbean75} (see arguments given along with Eqn. (13)) and \cite{lenschow74} (see their Fig. 8). This BC is further justified by \cite{fuhrmann10} who states that:  ``\dots a zero-gradient condition for $k$ [here $e$] can be interpreted physically as specifying a zero flux of turbulent kinetic energy normal to a wall. This condition should in fact hold quite generally, as a wall (be it rough or smooth) is neither a direct source nor a sink of turbulent kinetic energy.''

The zero TKE condition $e(z=0)=0$ follows \cite{teixeira04} and could easily be modified to something like  $e(z=0)=3.75 u_*^2+0.2w_*^2$ (see \cite{witek11}). The Dirichlet condition still makes use of the bulk drag law which formulates the kinematic flux as 
\begin{equation}
 F_e=\mathbf{v_h}_1| C_{\mathbf{tke}} (e_{1/2}-e_1)
\end{equation}
and thus an appropriate transfer coefficient $C_{\mathbf{tke}}$ has to be found. Since the surface value is generally smaller than the lowest atmospheric level, the emerging surfaces fluxes correpsond to a TKE sink. 

If $e$ and $K$ were located on half-levels then a downward extrapolation of $K$ would be necessary. To illustrate this, let us write down the tendency for an atmosphere with a constant $e$ profile and a surface value $e_s$. Since there are no ED fluxes within the atmosphere, the tendency within a first model layer of thickness $\Delta z_1$ is 

\begin{eqnarray}
 \left(\frac{\partial e}{\partial t}\right)_1 &=& F_e/\Delta z_1=|\mathbf{v_h}_1| C_{\mathbf{tke}} (e_{1/2}-e_1)/\Delta z_1
\end{eqnarray}
If $e$ was located on half-levels the equivalent tendency for the same layer would be obtained, as
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left(\frac{\partial e}{\partial t}\right)_1 &=& K_{1/2} (e_{1/2}-e_{3/2})/\Delta z_1^2= 2 K_{1/2} (e_{1/2}-e_{1})/\Delta z_1^2 
\end{eqnarray}
whereby we used the common linear interpolation $e_{1}=1/2(e_{1/2}+e_{3/2})$ and $K_{1/2}$ would be the eddy viscosity at the surface. From this it follows that $C_{\mathbf{tke}}$ has to take on the value 
\begin{equation}
 C_{\mathbf{tke}}= 2 K_{1/2}/ (|\mathbf{v_h}_1|  \Delta z_1)
\end{equation}
in order to yield the same tendency within that layer. To obtain $K_{1/2}$ a downward extrapolation (e.g., $K_{1/2}=K_{1}$ or $K_{1/2}=K_{3/2}$) is necessary. {\color{blue} The formulation of the Dirichlet condition is still somewhat arbitrary due to the extrapolation. Do you guys have better guidelines on this? Use similarity theory to derive $K$ at the surface? }Cleary, -- unless $e_{1/2}=e_{1}$ -- the two BCs yield different fluxes. 

To illustrate this the Witek closure is used without MF contribution and with the two different formulations for the surface BC. Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:BC}.  A negative flux results from the Dirichlet condition. Since TKE has a sink at the surface, TKE values are smaller in this run and the tke flux more negative near the surface. The $\theta$ profiles are thus less well mixed and the CPBL less deep. Note that the TKE profiles are closer to observed values. However, the increased negative fluxes of TKE are in stark contrast to the upward TKE fluxes found throughout the CPBL by \cite{lenschow74} (see their Fig.~8). Clearly, with ED fluxes alone the model is unable to maintain both positive fluxes and an upward increase of TKE. {\color{blue} Could we fix this by adding a MF part to the tke transport? Do recent MF models include tke transport? \cite{angevine10} seems to have an MF term for $e$. Haven't read the paper in detail yet. \cite{witek11} also reports the lack of transport of $e$.}

 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/CPBL_BC.eps}
\caption{Comparison of the influence of the lower BC for the CPBL after 6 hours. The Witek closure is used without MF fluxes. Black (red) curves show results from the zero-flux (zero $e$) condition. } \label{fig:BC}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mixing length scale}

Four different experiments are carried out to test the influence of the mixing length formulation within the Witek TKE closure. Again, no MF part is used here. The reference formulation is the one described above for the Witek closure and follows \cite{suselj13}. In this reference formulation we choose a length scale that is proportional to $\tau = 0.5 h/w_*$. Two experiments are carried out for which $\tau$ is fixed at 400 and 600~s, respectively. The fourth run is the same as the reference but the correction (shortening) of the length scale in stable regions is dropped. This yields the formulation proposed by \cite{teixeira04}. 

Results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lmix}. In general, a reduction in the mixing length yields less well mixed profile of $\theta$. Fixing $\tau$ at 600 s (blue curve) reproduces well the profiles obtained by the reference run (shown in black). A reduction to 400~s, however, yields a significantly less mixed CPBL that is also slightly more shallow.  

Switching off the stability correction of the length scale results in larger entrainment into the CPBL through the inversion. For this reason, the CPBL deepends faster. Interestingly, the length scale becomes larger also in the unstable parts of the CPBL even though the formulation has technically no influence in this part of the CPBL. For this reason, this formulation yields the most well-mixed CPBL of all four experiments. The increase of $l$ within the unstable parts of the CPBL can be understood by considering the fractional change of the mixing length $l \sim \tau e^{1/2} \sim h/w_*^2 (w_*^2 e/w_*^2)^{1/2} \sim h (e/w_*^2)^{1/2}$, given by
\begin{equation}
 \delta \ln l = \delta \ln h + 1/2 \delta \ln e/w_*^2.
\end{equation}
An increase in the boundary layer depth and increase in the dimensionless TKE increases $l$. Figure \ref{fig:lmix} shows that the latter decreases, but TKE itself is almost unchanged. Therefore, we can use the definition of $w_*\sim h^{1/3}$ to rewrite
\begin{equation}
\delta \ln e/w_*^2 = \delta \ln e - \delta \ln w_*^2 = \delta \ln e - 2/3 \delta \ln h
\end{equation}
which -- after subsituting in the equation above -- finally yields
\begin{equation}
 \delta \ln l = 2/3 \delta \ln h + 1/2 \delta \ln e.
\end{equation}
The peak value of $e$ is almost unchanged such that the last term can be dropped. The CPBL depth $h$ increases by 10\% yielding a 6\% increase in the mixing length $l$. This is in good agreement with Fig.~\ref{fig:lmix}. The physical interpretation is that the \cite{teixeira04} length scale allows for larger sizes of entraining eddies near the inversion, which results in a deeper CPBL, which in turn promotes larger eddies within the unstable parts of the CPBL.   

This brings us to the question whether the \cite{suselj13} formulation in combination with a larger $\tau$ could yield a similary well-mixed layer as obtained when dropping the stability-correction (i.e., shortening) of the length scale in the stable part? To explore this, the range of simulations has been extended with $\tau$ ranging from 600 s to 2200 s in 400 s increments.

These five simulations (see gray curves) together with the one without stability correction (using (light green) $\tau=0.5h/w_*$ and (dark green) $\tau=1400$~s) are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:taus}.  Cleary, the $\theta$ profile converges toward a well-mixed CPBL as $\tau$ increases. However, the entrainment flux converges to a value smaller than the one from the simulation without stability correction. As a consequence, the stable part near the inversion is more shallow in all of these simulations and the curvature of the $\theta$ profile larger (i.e., sharper inversion). Note that increasing $\tau$ to 1400 s without the stability correction yields a similarly well-mixed profile in the lower part of the CPBL as with correction, but -- again, due to considerably larger entrainment fluxes at the inversion -- an even deeper CPBL with a deeper stable upper part than obtained with the correction applied. Thus, the inversion remains less sharp than in runs with the correction. The mean temperature in this case is considerable higher due to the strong entrainment.  {\color{blue} Which formulation is better when compared to observation or LES? What's better suited for a combination with MF? Why?}

The latter results in the length scale described by \cite{teixeira04}. Profiles are shown after 6 hours if not mentioned otherwise.} \label{fig:lmix}

\end{figure}

\subsection{MF closure}

The MF flux has been parameterized by a variety of different closures. Both single plume and multiplume versions have been used with different flavors of entrainment rates and initial conditions. To start with we here test the sensitivity of a single plume model with respect to initial conditions and entrainment rates. We employ the same CPBL case \citep{nieuwstadt93,witek11} as was already used above.

\subsubsection{Initial conditions}

We introduced two different formulations for the plume's initial conditions (IC). If the multiplume model version is used (but for one plume) then some intial $w_i$ will be assigned to the plume. Let's call these Cheinet conditions. Its thermodynamic properties follow through the correlations with $w$. In the other singleplume version $\theta_v'$ is directly related to the surface buoyancy flux through $\beta$ and $w_i$ is assumed to be zero. Let's call these Soares conditions. Are the two formulations comparable?

To answer this let's ask the following question: What $\beta$ yields intial conditions such that the initial plume buoyancy is the same in the Cheinet formulation? In other words, under what conditions is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:equality}
 0.58 w_i\sigma_{\theta_v}/\sigma_w=\beta \overline{w'\theta_v'}/e^{1/2}
\end{equation}
satisfied?

To answer that, let's plug the definitions of $\sigma_{q_v}$ and $\sigma_{\theta}$, Eqs. (\ref{eqn:sigmaq}) and (\ref{eqn:sigmath}), into $\sigma_{\theta_v}$ (Eq. (\ref{eqn:sigmathv})). If we then assume that $r_{\theta q_v}=1$, we yield the simple expression
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{\theta_v}=1.34 \theta_v^*(z_s/h)^{-1/3} 
\end{equation}
with $\theta_v^*=\overline{w'\theta_v'}/w^*$. Then, we take $w_i$ as a fraction of its standard deviation $w_i=a_w \sigma_w$. Plugging this and the simple form of $\sigma_{\theta_v}$ in the equality (\ref{eqn:equality}), and further assuming that $e=0.2w*^2$, then we obtain the condition 
\begin{equation}
 \beta = 0.58\cdot 1.34 \sqrt{0.2}a_w (z_s/h)^{-1/3}.
\end{equation}

{\color{blue} For typical values of $z_s=50$~m and $h=2000$~m, $\sigma_w$ takes on a value of around 0.6~m/s such that a 1~m/s inital updraft would have the same initial buoyancy in the two formulations if $\beta$ is around 2. If $\beta=0.3$ then equal buoyancies are assigned to an initial updraft if $w_i=0.15~$m/s in Cheinet's model. This estimate will be somewhat sensitive to the actually obtained $e$.}

To test this estimate, we employ the same CPBL case \citep{nieuwstadt93,witek11} as been used already above. The entrainment rate is fixed at $\epsilon=1$~km$^{-1}$ and we do not allow for plume saturation for now. Also, we fix $e=0.2w_*^2$ in the definition of the Soares condition. The effect of using the actual $e$ will be tested later. Further, we say both the Cheinet and Soares model assume a plume fraction of 0.1 (even though the average $w_i$ computed in the Cheinet model is for a larger fractional area of 0.3).

We then run the Cheinet multiplume model with a single plume and compare it against the single-plume model after Soares for a variety of $\beta$. The resulting profiles of plume buoyancy and vertical velocity are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICs}. For the Cheinet run $w_1\approx0.7$~m/s such that -- based on the estimate above -- we would expect the two formulations to yield the same buoyancies if $\beta=1.4$. This is indeed the case, such that the vertical velocity profiles, the $\theta$ profile, and the buoyancy flux profile (and its partitioning into ED and MF) arrive at a great match for $\beta=1.4$. 

With larger $\beta$ the plume buoyancy and velocity increases. While the total buoyancy flux remains fairly constant, the MF contribution more and more replaces the ED contribution as $\beta$ increases. Despite seemingly small changes in the flux profile, increasing $\beta$ yields more well-mixed profiles of $\theta$. {\color{blue} Note that none of the profiles agrees with the slightly stable stratification seen in LES \citep{witek11}. This will be explored in the next section. }

Shown are profiles of plume buoyancy, plume vertical velocity, the mean $\theta$ profile, and the total, MF and ED buoyancy fluxes. All profiles are obtained after 6 hours of simulation.} \label{fig:ICs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Plume equation and mixing length}

In an attamept to reconstruct \cite{witek11}'s findings, who showed considerably more stable $\theta$ profiles thanks due to the inclusion of MF from a single plume, we here departed from \cite{suselj13}'s plume and length scale formulation and test \cite{witek11}'s ``faster'' plumes and the Teixeira length scale (which doesn't have \cite{suselj13}'s stability correction). Plumes have larger acceleration rates due to different coefficients in the $w$ equation. Results are also compared against two ED versions for reference. Figure~\ref{fig:abcl} shows results from these test. Note that for now we stick with the Soares IC ($\beta=0.3$ and $s_1=\sigma=0.1$) but fix $e=0.2w_*^2$ in its definition. We so far also use a constant entrainment rate of $\epsilon=1$~km$^{-1}$.

It can be seen that the red and green profiles of $\theta$ are the most stable ones. These are the simulations with the Witek plume. The plume velocities are considerable larger and thus the MF flux is larger. Comparing green and orange (same length scale, different plume model) shows that the faster plumes lead to more entrainment at the top of the CPBL. Note how the fraction of the buoyancy flux carried by MF is larger in the Witek model throughout the CPBL. The same observation is made from comparing the red and blue curves (which uses the Suselj length scale).

The main influence of the difference in length scale formulation is as described above for the ED-only version (now comparing blue with orange and green with red). Without the stability correction the PBL height is deeper due to a larger entrainment flux through the top. Moreover, with the Teixeira length scale the CPBL is more well mixed because larger eddies are supported in a deeper CPBL (larger mixing length). Also, (comparing green and red) the entrainment flux is mostly due to MF if the stability correction suppresses ED mixing at the inversion.   

{\color{blue} Note that instead of changing the plume formulation, changing the entrainment formulation might have the same positive effect on the $\theta$ profile. This has to be tested.}

Also evaluated is the effect of the stability correction/shortening term in the length-scale formulation. Two ED versions are shown as reference.} \label{fig:abcl}

\subsubsection{Entrainment rate}

Three formulations of the entrainment rate are compared next. Fixed entrainment rate, Witek's formulation, and Neggers' formulation. IF the \cite{suselj13} plume coefficients are used then we employ $\alpha_n=2/3$ which is a third of the value proposed by \cite{witek11} since updraft velocities are smaller. If \cite{witek11}'s plume coefficients are used then we choose $\alpha_n=4/3$, for reasons explained below.

Figure~\ref{fig:entrain} show that for the slow plumes (on the right) the influence of the entrainment rate on mixing is generally small, simply because the fluxes are dominated by the ED part. For the fast plumes, larger entrainment rates lead smaller plume velocities. For this reason, the larger entrainment rates lead fo more unstable $\theta$ profiles. The positiv eeffect of the MF is lost if entrainment becomes large. We tuned the coefficient in the $\epsilon=1/w$ formulation such that the entrainment rate becomes close to the one from the $\epsilon=1/l$ and $\epsilon=1$~km$^{-1}$ formulation. The resulting vertical velocities are very similar for this reason. The gradients in the $\theta$ profiles are also very similar for these runs. The actual magnitude of $\theta$ differs only because the $\epsilon~1/l$ simulation (blue) kills the MF and its top-down entrainment.
